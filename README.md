# Boxer - Interactive A.I. Robot Toy
The Boxer Interactive A.I. Robot Toy, produced by Spin Master, appears to have been discontinued. It is no longer widely available through major retailers, and listings for it are often marked as "clearance" or "sold out," indicating that it is no longer in active production. 

With Flipper Zero, you can now interact with Boxer, unlocking various play features such as different game modes and activities. Flipper Zero allows you to activate games and behaviors that were previously accessed through the app, offering a new way to engage with Boxerâ€™s interactive capabilities without relying on a mobile device.

Here's how to Activate these features with Flipper Zero

1. Copy wav files into the Flipper Zero microSD card (\wav_player\Boxer).
2. Open the WAV Player and go to previous folder.
3. Turn on the robot and press the back button for about 3 seconds.
4. Select on Flipper an audio and play it.
